//WorldMapAddon by Cole#1295-Discord(Message me if any problems)

// There are multiple image examples to know where to place things and what components to add.
// Player Indicator was working but was not working on last test...(Still added though)
// To change the speed of the dragging open the CameraDrag Script and you will see this below (Add "CameraDrag" Script to "WorldMap Camera" if it is not already.)
//                                                    
// transform.position = new Vector3(basePos.x + ((clickOrigin.x - dragOrigin.x) * .20f), basePos.y + ((clickOrigin.y - dragOrigin.y) * .20f), -10);
//                                                                                 ^^^                                                  ^^^
